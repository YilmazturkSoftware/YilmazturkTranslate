# Yilmazturk Translate
* Bu dosya Türkçe değil. [Türkçe okuyun](https://github.com/YilmazturkSoftware/YilmazturkTranslate/blob/main/README.md)
* Version: v1.0

# What Is It For
* This script translates the given strings to other strings without using any APIs or being connected to an online service. It changes the given string to another string, for example, (HELLO, MERHABA). It also translates the text values of all objects in the form you use it, and it also translates the items in ListBox.

# Usage
* Add the script to your source code.
* Use the following code in your form:
  ```csharp
  YilmazturkTranslate.Translate(this);
  // THIS CODE STARTS THE TRANSLATION.
  ```
* Now it's working.

# Additional Note
* You can make additions or modifications to the script as you wish. Also, if you find any changes or errors, you can send Issues or Pull Requests. You support the project with what you do.
